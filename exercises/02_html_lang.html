<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
  HTML tags can have attributes that contain extra information about the
  element. For example, <html lang="en"> opens a root HTML tag and specifies
  that the language of the content within is in English.

  FIXME: The <html> tag is missing its lang attribute’s value! The lang
  attribute is the key to enabling functionality like page translation (if the
  browser supports it) and for assistive technology like screen readers. For
  this document, the lang attribute’s value should be "en".
