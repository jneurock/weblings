<!--
  This is an HTML document. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, the
  standard markup language web browsers use to display web pages. HTML documents
  may contain plain text but they may also contain many different elements that
  enable user input, images, links and much more.

  HTML elements are described via tags. Tags are surrounded by angle brackets,
  "<" at the beginning and ">" at the end, e.g., <p> which opens a paragraph
  element and </p> which closes the paragraph element.

  The tag containing the text you are reading right now is a comment. Comments
  are ignored by the browser but are often used to provide helpful information
  to the human readers of the source code.

  Below is the DOCTYPE. It is required. <!DOCTYPE html> ensures that browsers
  don’t render the document according to some other specification.

  FIXME: The DOCTYPE is incomplete! Replace the 3 question marks with the
  correct code.

<!--
  Below is the <html> tag. You can think of this as the parent element for all
  the other elements in the document.
