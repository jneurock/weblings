    Below is the <head> element. It contains metadata (i.e., data about data)
    about the web page. Metadata can include things like the page title and
    description, the character set, viewport settings, stylesheet links, page
    icons and more.

    The title element is always required; though, itâ€™s also best to include two
    <meta> elements as seen below.

    FIXME: This document is missing its title! Check the previous exercises to
    see what this should be.
